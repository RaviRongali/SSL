HTML

Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/html   

   In this lab, the goal is to make your homepage as file called index.html
   This is written in the HTML format.
   
   
Part A
   
   HTML format is nothing but information contained in tags such as
  
    <html>
    <b> Hanumanth Rao </b>
    </html>
    
   The above file will display just that one statement in bold face font when 
   you see this file in a browser.
   
    The browser renders the fonts and tables, but the html file is just a text file which you
     will edit in vim. By that you will learn both vim and html.
     
     Once you make a simple html file, upload it in your public_html directory as follows:
     
      scp index.html username@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in:public_html/.
     
     (If there is any change in this, the TAs will inform you!)
     
     Now you can keep adding more content in this file, first on the current desktop and then by uploading it to make it live.
     Before you upload, you can simply double click on the file and it will open locally to show you what it actually looks like.
      
      The content that you should add in your index.html:
       
        0. Insert text with different fonts (italics, bold etc) and with different sizes (small, big, huge etc)
	1. Insert an image
	2. Insert a table M rows and N columns and fil up as per your choice
	3. Add three hyperlinks 
	        a. Link to our dept home page
		a. Link within the same page
		b. To an external link such as an online dictionary
	4. A list (either ordered or unordered)

----------------------------------------
