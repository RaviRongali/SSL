Latex Basics

In this lab you will learn to use LateX to create
beautiful PDF documents. You have been given one pdf file as a task.
It includes several features of Latex. You have to produce all of them.
You are free to use your own text, but all the feature demonstrated
in the PDF task file must be put on display in your PDF output. You may
make your own figure using any of the profiles in Dia. However you should use
features such as connections, different shapes, connectors with 
arrow heads, etc.

What to submit:

 one tarball (use the method described in the previous lab) with
 name as <rollno>-lab2.tar.gz
 including the following files:
 
   .tex    source
   .pdf    the output that you got
   .dia    the figure that you made
   .eps/.png/.jpg  the figure that you exported and used in .tex file
   
    
    Good luck!!
