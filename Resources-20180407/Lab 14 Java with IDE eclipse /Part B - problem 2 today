Part A
  submission not required
  
Part B


How to submit:
	use export from eclipse to create one single archive file of your entire project.
	in Eclipse, start a new project called rollno_lab10
	keep adding your java file  of all questions into this.
	The archive zip file will include all of this.
	upload this zip file.
	file->export->general->archive file --> give name as rollno_lab14.zip

----------------------------------

Submit any 3 out of following 4

Q1) CountPrimes.java:

Build a java program which will compute total number of prime numbers within the 
range 1 to x where x is an upper bound. e.g. 100,
1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000. The aim is to print the CPU time in ns. 

output format:
	X	no. of prime numbers	Time taken in ns


Q2) ClickTriangle.java

Make an applet which will show the position of the mouse pointer when the 
mouse is over it and capture the first 3 clicks to
draw a triangle with labels (A, B, C) according to the respective 
order of the clicks.

Q 3) ClickPolygon.java

Modify the above program to draw a polygone. When the user finishes
clicking, she simply moves out of the window. At that point, the polygon
should be closed.


Q 4) Evaluator.java: 
Develop an expression evaluator which accepts 4 arguments
 a string expression,      left_x_val,  right_x_val,    step

and which dumps the list of result values against x values
 after the substitution

 
 e.g 

java Evaluator "x^2+3*x+2" -2 3 1 

would dump:

-2.00 0.00
-1.00 0.00
0.00 2.00
1.00 6.00
2.00 12.00
3.00 20.00 

        
the numbers are of type Double, and while printing, use 2 decimals.     

Grammar for the expression:

allowed operators and priorities: ^ / * + -
no brackets
unknown variable: only x                
numbers are positive
integers or double in format 1,2,.. 1.3, 2.22, etc
no spaces in expression


use any algorithm of your choice.
Feel free to use collection data structures
such as ArrayList, Stack, and tokenizers like StringTokenizer.
and System.out.format for formatted output.


There can be many classes inside your solution:
 but,
        class Evaluator  carries main
                we will use this.
                
you may use other internal classes as your helper classes.
