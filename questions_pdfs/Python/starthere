Intro to Python Programming
we shall do more advanced stuff in the next lab, get
fully conversant with Python now through the lab
statement
----------------------------------------------

How to execute:

 python3.4 myprog.py
 

execute all demo programs first and observe the behavior
python is a dynamically typed language
you won't see types 
you directly start using variables
syntax for if, for is a bit different from java/c++
indentation is very important-- we don't have curly braces for program blocks, 
	we just use indentation-- observe it in the programs
	
lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples etc are available

program executes as long as there is no typing error
